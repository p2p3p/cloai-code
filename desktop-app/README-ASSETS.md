# Desktop Refactor Asset Map

This directory is the planned static-asset layout for `desktop-app`.
Asset contents are copied byte-for-byte from the restored `desktop/` tree so the
UI can stay visually identical while imports and URL paths move to clearer
domains.

## Layout

| New directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `public/branding/` | App icons and public brand assets loaded by HTML, Tauri, or URL. |
| `public/runtime/` | Public runtime files loaded by fixed URL, such as workers and standalone HTML. |
| `public/artifact-gallery/` | Runtime artifact gallery JSON and preview images served from public URLs. |
| `assets/branding/` | Bundler-imported Claude/Anthropic brand marks. |
| `assets/message-activity/` | Assistant typing/thinking sprites, lottie files, and frame images. |
| `assets/fixtures/` | Static JSON data used by gallery pages, mocks, or fixture-style imports. |
| `assets/home/` | Chat landing composer, prompt suggestion, model selector, and plus-menu assets. |
| `assets/customization/` | Connector logos, directory controls, directory nav, plugin icons, and customization landing art. |
| `assets/navigation/` | App shell, sidebar, code mode, and navigation icons. |
| `assets/profile-menu/` | Profile/account dropdown icons. |
| `assets/scheduled/` | Scheduled task page icons. |
| `assets/projects/` | Project page empty-state art. |

## Public Assets

| Old path | New path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `desktop/public/anthropic.svg` | `desktop-app/public/branding/anthropic-logo.svg` | Public Anthropic logo. |
| `desktop/public/favicon.ico` | `desktop-app/public/branding/app-icon.ico` | Tauri installer/window icon source. |
| `desktop/public/favicon.png` | `desktop-app/public/branding/app-icon.png` | Browser favicon and apple touch icon. |
| `desktop/public/icon-mac.png` | `desktop-app/public/branding/mac-app-icon.png` | macOS application icon image. |
| `desktop/public/code-recharge.html` | `desktop-app/public/runtime/code-recharge.html` | Standalone recharge page served as static HTML. |
| `desktop/public/pyodide-worker.js` | `desktop-app/public/runtime/pyodide-worker.js` | Pyodide worker loaded by runtime URL. |
| `desktop/public/artifacts/code/_index.json` | `desktop-app/public/artifact-gallery/code/manifest.json` | Public artifact code manifest; renamed from `_index` for clarity. |
| `desktop/public/artifacts/code/remixed-*.json` | `desktop-app/public/artifact-gallery/code/remixed-*.json` | Artifact code payloads fetched by gallery/runtime renderer. |
| `desktop/public/artifacts/previews/*` | `desktop-app/public/artifact-gallery/previews/*` | Public artifact preview images. Leaf filenames are preserved to match `img_src` values. |

## Artifact Gallery Fixtures

| Old path | New path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `desktop/src/data/inspirations.json` | `desktop-app/assets/fixtures/artifact-gallery/inspirations.json` | Inspiration/gallery item catalog. |

Artifact code payloads and preview images are retained only under
`public/artifact-gallery/` because current components fetch them by runtime URL.
The duplicate importable copies were removed after static reference checks found
no live imports.

## Not Migrated

The following restored assets were not copied because no current runtime import,
dynamic URL load, or data reference was found during the static scan:

| Old path | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `desktop/src/assets/figma-exports/asset-*.png` | Raw Figma dump filenames with no current code references. |
| `desktop/src/assets/figma-exports/vectorized*.svg` | Raw/vectorized Figma exports with no current code references. |
| `desktop/src/assets/figma-exports/svg-converted/asset-*.svg` | Converted Figma dump assets with no current code references. |

If future refactor work discovers a live reference to one of these files, copy it
into the matching domain directory rather than reintroducing `figma-exports/`.
